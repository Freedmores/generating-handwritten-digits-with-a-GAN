# GAN for Generating Handwritten Digits #
Learning how to implement a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch Lightning to generate handwritten-style images.

This repository contains an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch Lightning to generate handwritten-style images. The project focuses on training a GAN with a simple generator-discriminator setup, tracking training progress with plotted images every 5 epochs, and testing the generator with random noise input.
